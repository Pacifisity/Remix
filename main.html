      <p>I used to be the math wizard, grades ahead of others my age. However, with just one opportunity to choose my own book... I jumped into the ocean of literature and swam away from the shore, never looking back. This is my website remix of project one, the personal narrative.</p>

        I am a reader learning how to write. In middle school when I got my first opportunity to freely choose what to read for my project, I fell in love with reading. I didn’t have a huge pool of books that I could choose from, and the books all related to the dire times of Nazi Germany, but I was satisfied with any freedom I could get. The teacher began to explain the due dates for when we were supposed to have read everything but at this point, I had tuned her out. I was basically focused on reading the first few pages of each book and making the most of my time. Eventually, one piqued my curiosity: Prisoner B-3087. In a few pages, I was already hooked and by the end of class, I was so lost in the book that I forgot about all of the other choices.
        The exaggerated tone and emotion-jerking scenery made me addicted to the sight of every page. I love it when a book can mix the characters’ actions and lives into one. I can’t stand stories that are concurrent scenes that revolve around fights for their lives because the stories don’t have any life to me. However, without action, it becomes almost too hard to read. Prisoner B-3087 was my bread and butter; I couldn’t put it down. Jack Gruener, our Jewish protagonist who has been through countless concentration camps was just going through the motions: being starved, tortured and worked mercilessly. The next morning he awakens to bullets raining down on all the prisoners from a revolving minigun. My mind raced with images as my eyes flew across the pages. When I finished the book, it was time for bed. In just one day, I had read a book that was supposed to last us three weeks. On one hand, I was happy that I had no other tasks for that class; on the other hand, I missed living vicariously through the prisoner.

        It was just too difficult to find something within the many written books that come to life each year. However, I found myself watching anime with some friends one day and the characters that made me feel like I was watching a cartoon made for my age range gave me an outlet. I will never forget my first anime, Sword Art Online, despite the hatred it gets; I still loved it. I don’t generally like watching shows and made my way into manga which is basically just a Japanese comic book. I felt like I was going in the right direction! I enjoyed the stories where I could almost write it within my imagination because there were very few words properly translated in the first place. I was a fish in water swimming through the oceans of literature.
        However, MangaDex, the site which I was using to read the stories, was hacked. My access to free, unlimited manga was ripped away from me. The bookmarks that I had saved were lost. All of the stories which I was waiting for to be completed were gone. Even worse, most of the titles were not translated which caused me to be unable to look them up on my own. I sought a new place to find titles and used the built-in bookmark system of my browser, but to this day, I have never been able to find a site as accessible and easy to use as MangaDex. Then Josh, a close friend of mine from an online chat app called Discord, who would discuss and suggest stories with me, introduced me to light novels which were just as terribly translated as manga but this time with a lot more words.
        When I started reading my first light novel, familiarly titled Super Gene, I was lost. Despite it being clearly morphed into a story fit for western readers, light novels have an average of 1,000 chapters per story and everything seemed exciting to me. I wondered how someone could keep up with a story for that long and still keep it interesting. Weeks later, I was 1,300 chapters into Super Gene and it finally started getting bland. I wasn’t disappointed because I expected it to become like that eventually. I just didn’t think that I would ever have the opportunity to grow with a character who fought monsters all day.  
        I read as Han Sen fought, life on the line, against all kinds of monsters. Mr. Han fought for his family, and enjoyed the life that fighting rewarded him. Ultimately breathing vitality into new lives. I finally found what I was looking for. The author has to write so many chapters that it causes the story to have many rising and falling actions instead of the overarching single conflict that normal stories use.

        With the months I spent exploring light novels, it was only a matter of catching one of the many poorly translated titles before I discovered cultivation novels. A subgenre of fantasy where strength is categorized by milestones significant in Chinese culture. Characters are often extremely cautious and try to stay in their own area. As cultivators grow in strength, this trend increases because nobody wants to lose what they’ve already invested their life into.
        An example of this would be Han Jue, who hides in a cave for years on end and blasts any miscreants into smithereens. I liked these kinds of novels, so much so that I became obsessed and with the length of each light novel, 40 hours a week was spent reading about Chinese culture and fantasy. Milestones made an easy to understand system that spans throughout many different stories in Chinese culture cause the long stories that I read to become connected. After reading tens of thousands of pages of cultivation novels, the message I was given over and over again is the idea that pure martial (physical) strength is supreme.
        Through the use of qi (pronounced “chi”) - an inherent energy that is omnipresent in Chinese culture, cultivators create foundations of inner strength and nurture this energy to help themselves and others. Cultivators return to antiquity and unleash earth-shaking changes on their worlds. Han Jue, who I mentioned before, ascended from the world into a plane of existence so grand that just leaving a cultivator’s home world unprotected was risky. To protect it, Han Jue scooped the world up and nurtured it, this caused people born in that world to gain second hand strength and be permanently connected to Han Jue’s destiny. 
        Their culture caused the characters in each story about cultivation I read to reach similar milestones and it made me feel anticipation and dream about what their fights would look like if my heroes were all forced against each other. Each character also has very diverse personalities but generally maintain cautious and somewhat arrogant tendencies so when the personalities clash I can only imagine the heated dialogue. It’s too bad I can’t travel to the other end of the earth and force the authors into making my dream a reality, legally anyway.

        While the Chinese have their cultivation stories, the Japanese have a very distinct subgenre of fantasy that I enjoy as well, transmigration and dungeons. Putting a clear division between the peaceful world and taking the chaotic battlefield to a world that can only be described as hell. Dungeons tend to be connected to another planet, universe or even an entirely different reality where the rules have changed beyond recognition. 
        Infinite Mana in the Apocalypse, a story by Adui about Noah Osmont who explored a plethora of dungeons connected to a myriad of dimensions ruled by demons expanded onto the dungeon genre to a point where it was difficult to follow. The author attempted to make it easier to differentiate levels of strength using crazy translations that allowed me to learn about some english words that I would have never found otherwise. Terms like: “Quintessential”, “Aeonic” and “Nomological”.
        Though in another world centered around our hero Rimuru, a popular character from a story about being transmigrated into another world, likes to stick to one planet, and that planet is not Earth. Japanese light novels like this often have characters overworking themselves or being introduced to the infamous truck-kun, a phenomenon where when you’re being transmigrated to another world, you get hit by a truck! Characters are subsequently placed in an unfamiliar world with swords and magic. Rimuru, our Japanese hero who decided to break the stereotype was transmigrated as a slime, not even retaining their original form. Though, being overworked constantly probably made that a relief for our poor hero.

        I have read lots of different novels by this point. Surprisingly, my parents actually started watching anime now that my brother and I had shown an interest in it. After I realized their interest, I introduced my dad to light novels. Inhuman warlock, one that I felt would be interesting because the story was well written and the main character was not your generic, everyday guy. The story kept me hooked for a very long time because it wasn’t written for keeping your moral compass in line. It was not a story for the lighthearted, the screams of Lucifer even in word form are still vivid in my mind. The only thing you could hear over the screams was the scientist who managed to scream louder than Lucifer on the deathbed, “MORE!! MORE!! HE CAN STILL TAKE IT!”. 
        I had already read thousands of pages when I finally suggested it to my father and decided to keep within a hundred chapters to talk about the things that happened. One of the best choices I've ever made, if you’ve ever participated in a book club or something similar, you’d understand. It was an absolutely amazing time and my little brother joined us not long after. At that point we all hunkered down, finished it and came together to complain about the terrible translation and discuss the story that we shared. With such a unique main character, you could hardly even take the time to appreciate the unique personalities and stories of each character that made this story come to life.
        After that, I was able to suggest and take suggestions from them, allowing me to find new stories to enjoy and keep myself distracted. I created a long list of bookmarked stories from both cultures with thousands of hours of reading put into them. From exploring and invading other dimensions to protecting your own. I had the freedom to choose, and each book struck a chord in my heart. It was almost perfect. If only it was properly translated and I didn’t have to be distracted by the terrible punctuation, grammar and mismatched pronouns. I wish there was some way that I could keep my exaggerated vocabulary while maintaining a readable and enjoyable story.

        What is a translation? It’s just taking someone else’s words and turning it into your own, right? Well then what if I learn Chinese and just read the originals? How will I read the Japanese ones? I thought about learning the languages so that I could enjoy them in their original form but that sounded like a lot of work that wouldn’t be very beneficial to me. It originally didn’t sound realistic but even while writing this I found a desire to continue on this path.
        Not long after that realization, I found out what I had to do. If I was already subconsciously fixing it in my mind, why not just write it myself? That’s when my passion for reading translated itself into a passion for writing. It still exists, but both mean the same to me. Reading is just a way of rewriting someone else’s work into your own imagination. So writing must be a way of reading your imagination and putting it on paper for someone else to read.
